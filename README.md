# **Gene-based mapping of trehalose biosynthetic pathway genes reveals association with source- and sink-related yield traits in a spring wheat panel**

## Abstract
Trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) signalling regulates carbon use and allocation and is a target to improve crop yields. We used exome-capture sequencing on trehalose phosphate synthase (TPS) and trehalose phosphate phosphatase (TPP) genes and a large phenotypic data set for the dissection of the genetic architecture (e.g. using gene-based mapping, regional heritability, signature of selection, and gene-based prediction) of yield-related traits in a wheat (*Triticum aestivum*) breeding panel. Mapping population and phenotypic data analyses have been described by Molero *et al.* (2019). Briefly, we used the High Biomass Association Mapping Panel (HiBAP) comprising 149 wheat spring genotypes of the CIMMYT breeding programme. This panel was characterized into two main subpopulations consisting of 97 elite high yield and 52 exotic high biomass (landraces and pre-breeding) materials.
